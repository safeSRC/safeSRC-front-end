                      I'm a software developer with a knack for working with
                      teams and solving problems. Considering I grew up on a
                      cattle farm working with my cousins, and have spent over a
                      decade in professional kitchens as a chef working closely
                      with teams of all backgrounds, I feel like I am adept at
                      meeting teammates where they are with respect and enough
                      motivation to keep everyone focused on the task at hand. I
                      can be an asset with my ability to work on a team and come
                      up with solutions to problems.
